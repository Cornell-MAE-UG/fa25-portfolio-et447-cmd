#### Relevant Experience
- **AutoBoat Project Team - Boat Design and Manufacturing Member**  
  Sep, 2025 - Present  
  - Designed mounting solutions for electrical components on an autonomous boat, minimizing wire length while accounting for position, clearance, and accessibility requirements.
  - Performed hand calculations to analyze stresses and deflections on the enclosure, informing sheet metal dimensions and required supports. 
  - Manufactured prototype parts to validate design choices and inform improvements for future iterations. 
  - Coordinated with electrical, mechanical, and controls teams to understand evolving design changes and ensure interface compatibility across subsystems.
  

- **Cornell Rapid Prototyping Lab  - Laboratory Technician**  
  Oct, 2024 - Present  
  - Provided FDM, resin printing, and laser cutting services to research labs, MAE courses, and project teams.
  - Analyzed designs to determine required equipment for manufacturing, optimize slicer settings, and part orientation to meet aesthetic and structural requirements.
  - Managed large queues under time constraints to meet print deadlines.


- **University of Stavanger - Fluid Dynamics Summer Research Intern**  
  [May, 2025] - [Aug, 2025]  
  - Submitted research paper to ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering as first author in collaboration with researchers at the University of Stavanger. 
  - Modeled flow through a bend-pipe with a rough outlet using terminal-based CFD software OpenFOAM to determine the effects of varying surface roughness on the decay of Dean vortices. 
  - Optimized mesh density across 18 different cases using Gmsh to ensure complex flow features are fully resolved while decreasing computational cost.
  - Processed data using Python (Pandas and Matplotlib) and Paraview to identify trends, detect anomalies, and distinguish physical insights from simulation errors.
  - Compiled findings in a research paper, using a literature review to pinpoint research gaps to ensure the study delivered meaningful results.
